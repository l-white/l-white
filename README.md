👋 Hi, I’m Laura White. 
- 💻 I am an experienced full-stack software engineer, currently working as the Tecnical Lead at Zero to Mastery.
- 👀 I’m interested in everything related full-stack JavaScript, React and React frameworks, and improving software deployments through CI/CD and GitHub actions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about enterprise architecture in the context of microservices and preparing for the AZ-204 (Azure Developer) certification.
- 💞️ I’m passionate about mentoring junior software engineers and help answer students' questions in the Zero to Mastery Discord community with 400,000+ students and counting. 
- 💻 I created a C# Learning Path, particularly for students in the ZTM community. You can [fork the Github repo](https://github.com/l-white/c-sharp-path) and start learning if you're interested!
